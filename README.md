# Sketch-thru-Plan SDK .NET Resources

This project hosts developer resources related to  [Hyssos Tech's Sketch-Thru-Plan](http://www.hyssos.com) Natural Language Planning Engine SDK.

Sketch-Thru-Plan (STP) is a technological advance for today's warfighter that enhances cognition by implementing military doctrine driven, 
AI based task recognition that automatically perceives planners' implicit higher-order intentions, on the fly, generating Tasks, Task Matrix, 
Synch Matrix, and other OPORD products with minimal additional user input. 

This is accomplished via robust multimodal Natural Language Processing that fuses userâ€™s doctrinal speech and sketch for COA creation, 
seamlessly integrating plan outputs that drive simulators for tight adjudication loops and C2 systems. 

A TypeScript/JavaScript version of the SDK can be found at the [Sketch-Thru-Plan JavaScript SDK Resources GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyssostech/sketch-thru-plan-sdk-resources)


## Prerequisites
