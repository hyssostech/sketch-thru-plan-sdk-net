# Controls for scripts/release-manifest.sh (STP-709).
#
# The script was carried into this repository from sdk-js, where it had no
# tests either. It is the gate the whole release-integrity design turns on -
# SHA256SUMS is only a claim about "the published set" if something proves the
# manifest still describes that set - so shipping it untested would be taking
# the central control on trust.
#
# The case that matters most is CASE 2. `sha256sum -c` walks the MANIFEST, so
# it cannot see a file that exists in the directory but is absent from the
# manifest. That is not hypothetical here: attaching attestations.jsonl after
# generating SHA256SUMS creates exactly that state on every release. The old
# inline check would have passed while the release page carried a file the
# manifest said nothing about. Case 2 and its companion CONTROL below encode
# that difference so it cannot quietly regress.
